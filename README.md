### üìÑ Database Schema & Query Scripts

You can view the full schema in [`store-schema.sql`](./assets/store-schema.sql).  
You can view the full queries in [`store-queries.sql`](./assets/store-queries.sql).

To run and test the queries, here's the sample data files
[`small_data_set-1000orders.sql`](./assets/order_data-1000records.sql),
[`large_data_set-10000orders.sql`](./assets/order_data-10000records.sql).

### üìö Queries Table of Contents
	üîé 1. SQL query to generate a daily report of the total revenue for a specific date

	üéØ 2. SQL query to generate a monthly report of the top-selling products in a given month

	üí∞ 3. SQL query to retrieve a list of customers who have placed orders totaling more than $500 in the past month

	üìÖ 4. SQL query to search for all products with the word "camera" in either the product name or description.

	üë• 5. SQL query to suggest popular products in the same category for the same author excluding the purchased product from the recommendations?


### üìä Query Optimizations

reports (daily, monthly, and customer-based) queries using normalized VS denormalized tables

- **Summary Tables**:  
  `daily_report` and `monthly_report` store pre-aggregated results to enable faster and more efficient reporting queries.

- **Denormalized Views**:  
  `customer_orders` simplifies joins across `customer`, `order` to improve performance.

### Summary tables 
```sql
-- SUMMARY TABLE FOR THE DAILY REVENUE
CREATE TABLE daily_report(
	order_date DATE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	revenue DECIMAL(12, 2)
);

-- SUMMARY TABLE FOR THE MONTLY TOP SELLING 5 PRODUCTS (PER UNITS)
CREATE TABLE monthly_report(
	sale_month DATE,
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    total_quantity INT UNSIGNED,

    PRIMARY KEY(sale_month, product_id)
);
```

<details>
<summary> üîÑ How Summary Tables Are Populated and Refreshed</summary>

### üü¢ Initial Data Loading (One-Time Setup)

These are run manually once to initialize the tables with historical data.

#### ‚úÖ Populate `daily_report` with historical daily revenue:

```sql
INSERT INTO daily_report(order_date, revenue)
SELECT
    order_date,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM `order`
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date;
```

#### ‚úÖ Populate `monthly_report` with top 5 products by month (historically):

```sql
INSERT INTO monthly_report(sale_month, product_id, product_name, total_quantity)
SELECT
	STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(sale_month, '-01'), '%Y-%m-%d') AS sale_month,
	product_id,
	product_name,
	total_quantity
FROM (
	SELECT
		DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_month,
		p.id AS product_id,
		p.name AS product_name,
		SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m')
			ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity) DESC
		) AS rn
	FROM product p
	JOIN order_item oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
	JOIN `order` o ON o.id = oi.order_id
	GROUP BY sale_month, p.id
) AS monthly_product_sales
WHERE rn <= 5;
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Query Optimization Comparisons (around 1000 orders)

Each section below compares the **original query** with its **optimized version**, and includes performance insights using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.


### üí∞  1. Daily Revenue Report

#### Sample output
```sql
| order_date | revenue   |
|------------|-----------|
| 2024-01-10 | 30248.92  |
```

#### üîç Original Query

```sql
SELECT order_date, SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM `order`
WHERE order_date = '2024-01-10' -- This's just an example date
GROUP BY order_date;
```

#### ‚ö° Improved Query

```sql
SELECT order_date, revenue
FROM daily_report
WHERE order_date = '2024-01-10'; -- This's just an example date
```

#### üìä Performance Comparison

<details>
<summary>View the performance comparison results</summary>

Using the summary table provides two main advantages:

1. **Aggregation is precomputed**, so the query skips the ```SUM()``` operation.

2. **Efficient indexing**: It leverages the summary table's primary key index directly, avoiding two index lookups (```order_date index``` -> ```primary key index```) required by the original query.


**Before Optimization:**

```
-- Execution Time: 0.0245 sec
-> Group aggregate: sum(`order`.total_amount)  (cost=0.9 rows=1.41) (actual time=0.0237..0.0238 rows=1 loops=1)
    -> Index lookup on order using order_date (order_date=DATE''2024-01-10'')  (cost=0.7 rows=2) (actual time=0.0185..0.0202 rows=2 loops=1)
```

**After Optimization (using summary table):**

```
-- Execution Time: 128e-6 sec
-> Rows fetched before execution  (cost=0..0 rows=1) (actual time=90e-6..164e-6 rows=1 loops=1)
```

</details>

### üìÖ 2. Monthly Top Selling Products

#### Sample output
```sql
| sale_month | product_id | product_name      | total_quantity |
|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2022-01-01 | 25         | Wireless Mouse    | 124            |
| 2022-01-01 | 74         | Gaming Keyboard   | 119            |
| 2022-01-01 | 72         | USB-C Cable       | 102            |
| 2022-01-01 | 75         | USB-C Cable2      | 90             |
| 2022-01-01 | 90         | USB-C Cable3      | 80             |
```

#### üîç Original Query

```sql
SELECT
	DATE_FORMAT('2022-01-01', '%Y-%m-01') AS sale_month,
    p.id AS product_id,
    p.name AS product_name,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM product p INNER JOIN order_item oi
ON p.id = oi.product_id
INNER JOIN `order` o ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2022-01-01' AND o.order_date < '2022-02-01' -- This's just an example date
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### ‚ö° Improved Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM monthly_report
WHERE sale_month = '2022-01-01' -- This's just an example date
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```

#### üìä Performance Comparison

<details>
<summary>View the performance comparison results</summary>

Using the `monthly_report` summary table provides two main advantages:

1. **Aggregation is precomputed**, so the query skips the ```SUM()``` operation.

2. **The triple join is skipped**: join between `product`, `order`, `order_item` tables is skipped

3. **Efficient indexing**: It leverages the summary table's primary key index directly

4. **Avoids the sorting**: The index is already sorted by total quantity

**Before Optimization:**

```

-> Limit: 5 row(s)  (actual time=0.667..0.669 rows=5 loops=1)
    -> Sort: total_quantity DESC, limit input to 5 row(s) per chunk  (actual time=0.666..0.667 rows=5 loops=1)
        -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=0.627..0.635 rows=37 loops=1)

**After Optimization:**

```

### üë• 3. A list of customers who have placed orders totaling more than $500 in the past month

#### üîç Original Query

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM `order` o JOIN  customer c
ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE
	o.order_date >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 1 MONTH, '%Y-%m-01') AND
    o.order_date < DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01')
GROUP BY c.id
HAVING total_amount > 500;
```

#### ‚ö° Improved Query

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(co.first_name, ' ', co.last_name) AS customer_name, SUM(co.total_amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer_orders co
WHERE
	co.order_date >= DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 1 MONTH, '%Y-%m-01') AND
    co.order_date < DATE_FORMAT(CURRENT_DATE, '%Y-%m-01')
GROUP BY co.customer_id, customer_name
HAVING total_amount > 500;
```
---

### üìä Performance Comparison


The performance impact of using a denormalized table (`customer_orders`) versus performing a join (`order` ‚®ù `customer`) varies with data size.

#### üîπ Small Dataset Test

*(1,000 orders, 100 customers)*

* The **join cost is minimal**, and performance between the two approaches is nearly identical.

**‚ñ∂ With Join:**

```
Execution time: 0.153s
-> Filter: (total_amount > 500)  (actual time=0.148..0.153 rows=21 loops=1)
    -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=0.145..0.148 rows=26 loops=1)
        -> Aggregate using temporary table  (actual time=0.144 rows=26 loops=1)
            -> Nested loop inner join
                -> Index range scan on o using order_date
                -> Single-row index lookup on c using PRIMARY (loops=30)
```

**‚ñ∂ With Denormalized Table:**

```
Execution time: 0.163s
-> Filter: (total_amount > 500)  (actual time=0.157..0.163 rows=21 loops=1)
    -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=0.154..0.157 rows=26 loops=1)
        -> Aggregate using temporary table
            -> Index range scan on co using order_date
```

#### üîπ Large Dataset Test

*(10,000 orders, 500 customers)*

* The **join cost becomes noticeable** due to the growing number of nested lookups.
* The **denormalized table outperforms** the join-based approach by avoiding those extra lookups.

**‚ñ∂ With Join:**

```
Execution time: 2.50s
-> Filter: (total_amount > 500)  (actual time=2.39..2.50 rows=234 loops=1)
    -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=2.39..2.44 rows=249 loops=1)
        -> Aggregate using temporary table
            -> Nested loop inner join
                -> Index range scan on o using order_date (360 rows)
                -> Single-row index lookup on c using PRIMARY (360 loops)
```

**‚ñ∂ With Denormalized Table:**

```
Execution time: 2.14s
-> Filter: (total_amount > 500)  (actual time=2.08..2.14 rows=234 loops=1)
    -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=2.08..2.11 rows=249 loops=1)
        -> Aggregate using temporary table
            -> Index range scan on co using order_date
```

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

* On **small datasets**, the join overhead is negligible, and both approaches perform similarly.
* On **larger datasets**, the denormalized table **significantly reduces query execution time** by eliminating join operations and reducing random I/O.

### üîé 4. Search for all products with the word "camera" in either the product name or description.
```sql
ALTER TABLE product ADD FULLTEXT INDEX `fulltext`(name, description);

SELECT id, name, price, description
FROM product
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('camera');
```

### üîé 5. Suggest popular products in the same category for the same author, excluding the purchased product from the recommendations
```sql
SELECT p.id, p.name, SUM(quantity) AS sales_count
FROM product p 
JOIN order_item oi ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE id <> 20 AND (category_id, author_id) IN ( 
	SELECT category_id, author_id
	FROM product
	WHERE id = 20
)
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY sales_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
